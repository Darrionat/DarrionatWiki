# PrisonPick

PrisonPick completely changes your Prison server and will add a fun new leveling aspect to it! Every player is given a unique pickaxe that they can upgrade with enchantments.

Fully supporting players having the same pickaxe over Bungee by using a MySQL database. Upgrades can be bought with experience levels, tokens from TokenManager, or in the future currency from Vault. A PAPI expansion can also be used to fetch player statistics.
