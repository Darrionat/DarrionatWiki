# Wands

### Obtaining a Wand

Wands are obtainable via crafting. The crafting recipe for a Wand is 2 diamonds in a vertical line above a blaze rod (a sword formation with the blaze rod as the stick). The recipe is not customizable; however, it most likely will be in the future.

### Configuration

The Wand's name and material can be configured within the [config.yml](configuration-files/config.yml.md).

### Enchanting

As of v4.3, enchantments may only be added to Wands via [Enchantment Tokens](enchants.md#enchantment-tokens). \
