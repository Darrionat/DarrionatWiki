# Custom Blocks

## Custom Blocks

Custom blocks are a feature within Custom Enchants+ that allows users to open up a [GUI](guis.md) by right-clicking the block. Each custom block has its own material already assigned to it. Custom blocks can be placed down or removed within [commands](commands-and-permissions.md). Each custom block is directly correlated to a GUI. A custom block will not work if the world they are in is disabled.
