# Scrolls

## Scrolls

Scrolls are custom items that have special effects for [custom enchanted](enchants.md) items. Each scroll is highly configurable within the [config.yml](configuration-files/config.yml.md). By default, each scroll has a 5% chance to be obtained from the [Tinkerer](guis.md#tinkerer). These percentages are added together, so overall, a player has a 25% chance to obtain a scroll from tinkering by default. A player can not obtain two scrolls from tinkering one item.
