# Trivia

{% hint style="info" %}
Trivia contains more hidden details but that are quite important to the plugin
{% endhint %}

### Config.yml Sorting

The [config.yml](configuration-files/config.yml.md) automatically sorts the cooldowns to avoid base commands overriding commands with arguments. E.g. /customenchants overriding /customenchants list. This is automatically fixed by the plugin!

### bStats

Command Cooldown utilizes bStats. This allows Darrionat to view the current standing of usage for the plugin.
